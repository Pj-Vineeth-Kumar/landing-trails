      { type: 'p', text: 'If you are running an immigration law firm today, you are almost certainly using case management software that was designed before anyone seriously believed AI would be doing real work. That is not a criticism — it is simply a fact of timing. The platforms that dominate immigration case management were built in the 2000s and 2010s, when the goal was to digitize paper processes and centralize case records. They did that well.' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'But the world has changed. AI agents can now perform genuine legal work — not just answer FAQ questions, but extract data from foreign documents, auto-fill government forms, track deadlines across thousands of cases, and identify dormant clients worth re-engaging. The question is not whether AI agents are ready. It is whether your platform is.' },
      { type: 'h2', text: 'What "AI-native" actually means' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'An AI-native platform is not one that has had AI features bolted on. It is one where the underlying data model, workflow architecture, and integration layer were designed from the ground up to support autonomous agents working alongside human attorneys.' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'This means case data is structured in a way that agents can read, reason over, and act on — not buried in PDF uploads and free-text notes. It means workflow state is exposed through APIs that agents can poll and update. It means the permission system understands the difference between what a human attorney should approve and what an agent can do autonomously.' },
      { type: 'h2', text: 'The hidden cost of legacy architecture' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'When you try to run AI agents on top of a legacy case management system, you encounter friction at every layer. The data extraction is unreliable because document storage was never designed for machine reading. The form auto-fill breaks because field mappings were built for humans, not pipelines. The deadline agent cannot monitor case state because there is no event stream — only a database that humans query manually.' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'This is why most firms that try to add AI to their existing stack end up with a collection of disconnected tools that require manual coordination. The AI is real, but the plumbing is not there to support it.' },

      { type: 'p', text: 'CodioCMS was designed from the ground up to run native AI agents. Every case record, document, questionnaire response, and workflow step is structured for machine-readable access. The AI agents we deploy — intake, document extraction, forms, deadline, client comms, renewal, BD, and government notice monitoring — run inside the same data layer as your attorneys. They do not need to screen-scrape or call external APIs to do their work.' },

It surfaces cases where a visa is approaching expiry, where a green card holder has now been a permanent resident long enough to apply for citizenship, where a beneficiary on an approved petition has not yet taken the next step, and where a matter closed without the client receiving advice on what comes next.' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'When it finds a match, it does not just flag a record. It drafts an outreach message — personalized to the client, referencing their specific matter — and queues it for attorney review before sending. The attorney approves, the message goes, and the client receives a relevant, timely communication from a firm they already know.' },

The range depends on the size of the firm and how long the database has been dormant.' },

If you have 500 former clients and 15% of them have an actionable immigration need, and 40% of those convert into new matters, and the average matter is $3,500 — that is $105,000 in revenue that was sitting in your database, invisible, waiting to be found.' },

      { type: 'p', text: 'Most immigration firms struggle to answer these questions well. Not because their technology is inadequate, but because they do not have the technical staff to translate what their platform does into the language that a corporate legal ops team or procurement officer expects.' },

These are not questions that most immigration attorneys are prepared to answer in technical detail.' },

We write about CodioCMS\'s permission architecture in the language that a CISO expects. We describe CodioForms\'s authority-syncing in terms that a compliance officer can evaluate. We answer questions about our security certifications (SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001, GDPR, CCPA) accurately and completely.' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'The attorney reviews the draft, approves it, and submits it under the firm\'s name.

The dominant immigration software platforms were built around USCIS forms — the I-130, I-485, H-1B package, N-400 — and everything else was either a workaround or an afterthought. Firms practicing in Canada, the Netherlands, India, or anywhere outside the US were left managing a patchwork of PDFs, government portals, and manual data re-entry.' },

It reflects a meaningful difference in what needs to happen for a case to be properly documented.' },

Name, date of birth, document number, expiry date, issuing authority, country. It translates foreign-language documents across 40+ languages. It classifies each file by document type and maps extracted fields directly into the CodioCMS case record.' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'Extraction is about getting data out of unstructured documents and into a format the system can use. It is fast, automated, and replaces what used to be a paralegal reading a document and typing information into a form.' },
      { type: 'h2', text: 'What validation does' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'The Document Validation Agent takes the extracted data and answers a different question: is this document sufficient for the case? It checks whether a passport expires within 6 months of the intended travel date. It verifies that a police clearance covers the required period. It flags a birth certificate that is missing an apostille for a country that requires one. It identifies gaps in the document checklist — items that have been requested but not yet received.' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'Validation is about case readiness. It is the check that happens after extraction, ensuring that what was submitted is not just readable but sufficient. In immigration practice, the cost of filing with an incomplete or invalid document is significant — RFEs, delays, and in some cases denials. Validation is what prevents that.' },
