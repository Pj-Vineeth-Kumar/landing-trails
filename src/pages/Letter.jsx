            To the immigration law firms and corporate immigration teams that have shaped my career -
          </p>

          <p className="reveal" style={proseStyle}>
            In 1999, I founded INSZoom because I saw an industry being underserved by technology.
            Immigration law was complex, document-heavy, deadline-driven, and globally distributed -
            and the tools available simply weren't built for it. So we built them.
          </p>

          <p className="reveal" style={proseStyle}>
            Over the next twenty years, we built INSZoom into the leading immigration case management
            platform in the world, serving more than 1,500 law firms across every kind of immigration
            practice. We watched solo attorneys grow into mid-size firms. We watched mid-size firms grow
            into enterprise practices. We watched corporate immigration teams scale to manage tens of
            thousands of cases. We learned what worked. And we learned, painfully sometimes, what didn't.
          </p>

          <p className="reveal" style={proseStyle}>
            When INSZoom was acquired in 2020, I stepped back. I spent time talking with the firms that
            had been our customers for years. I asked them what they needed next. The answers were
            remarkably consistent.
          </p>

          <p className="reveal" style={proseStyle}>
            They didn't need more software. They had software. They had too much of it. They didn't need
            another AI tool - they were drowning in AI tools they didn't know how to use. They didn't need
            another vendor - they had a list of vendors as long as their arm, and none of them coordinated.
          </p>

          <p className="reveal" style={proseStyle}>
            What they needed was someone to run their technology for them. Not sell them another tool.
            Not implement and disappear. Not promise outcomes and deliver features. They needed a partner
            who would build the right foundation, configure it to how they actually worked, run it day in
            and day out, and be accountable for the outcomes.

            I built INSZoom for the firms of the 2000s and 2010s. GlobalCodio is what those same firms -
            and the new ones rising up after them - deserve in the 2020s and beyond. It is what I would
            have built if I were starting an immigration firm today.
