  {
    question: 'What is CodioCMS?',
    answer:
      'CodioCMS is a next-generation immigration case management platform built by Umesh Vaidyamath, founder of INSZoom. It provides end-to-end case lifecycle management, five purpose-built portals (attorney, applicant, HR, service provider, admin), native AI agent integration, global country support, and customizable workflow automation for immigration law firms and corporate mobility teams.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What immigration forms does CodioForms support?',
    answer:
      'CodioForms supports 180+ US immigration forms (USCIS-synced), the full IRCC suite for Canada, Netherlands MVV and residence permits, and India visa and OCI forms. Every edition is tracked to the issuing authority, and new countries are scoped and built in days based on client priority.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How does CodioCMS differ from other immigration case management software?',
    answer:
      'CodioCMS is the only immigration case management platform designed from the ground up for native AI agents - not legacy software with AI bolted on afterward. It also includes five dedicated portals for different user roles, a global forms engine, and an Immigration Passport Vault giving applicants portable ownership of their records. Every engagement includes CodioOps - a dedicated team that configures and continuously optimizes the platform.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can we migrate from our current immigration software to CodioCMS?',
    answer:
      'Yes. GlobalCodio\'s team manages the full migration - data export from your current platform, data mapping and verification, workflow reconstruction in CodioCMS, and parallel operations until your team is fully transitioned. Typical migration takes approximately six weeks with zero active case disruption.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the Immigration Passport?',
    answer:
      'The Immigration Passport is a personal document record within CodioCMS where applicants store passports, visas, work permits, and supporting documents securely. Applicants control what they share and with whom. When they change employers, switch law firms, or start a new matter, their complete record travels with them - no re-submission or starting from scratch.',
  },
];

export const FAQ_AGENTS = [
  {
    question: 'What are Codio AI Agents?',
    answer:
      'Codio AI Agents are a team of 10 specialized autonomous AI workers purpose-built for immigration workflows. Each agent handles a specific stage of the immigration process: intake, document extraction, document validation, form preparation, deadline tracking, client communications, renewal detection, business development, ecosystem coordination, and government notice monitoring. They operate natively within CodioCMS, run 24/7, and are deployed and managed by GlobalCodio\'s team.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do AI agents handle attorney-client privilege and data security?',
    answer:
      'Codio AI Agents operate within the same role-based access controls as human staff - they cannot take any action that would require elevated permissions. All agent outputs are confidence-scored and flagged for attorney review before being applied to a case. GlobalCodio never trains AI models on client data. Every agent action is written to an immutable, cryptographically signed audit log.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How much time do AI agents save on immigration case preparation?',
    answer:
      'Immigration law firms on GlobalCodio typically see a 70% reduction in case preparation time. AI agents handle document extraction, form preparation, questionnaire processing, and deadline tracking - work that previously took hours takes minutes. The human equivalent of all eight core AI agents would cost approximately $499,000 per year in salaries.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can AI agents replace paralegals or case managers?',
    answer:
      'AI agents handle the repetitive, time-consuming work that paralegals and case managers currently do: document processing, form filling, deadline monitoring, client status updates, and renewal outreach. This frees your human team for strategy, client relationships, and the complex judgment that requires legal expertise. Most firms scale their caseload without adding headcount.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How does the Renewal Agent recover revenue?',
    answer:
      'The Renewal Agent continuously scans your existing client database for expiring visas, green card upgrade eligibility, citizenship eligibility, and dormant cases worth reopening. It identifies these opportunities, drafts outreach automatically, and tracks revenue recovered. Most firms recover $50,000–$300,000 in additional annual revenue from clients already in their database.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do we need technical staff to manage the AI agents?',
    answer:
      'No. GlobalCodio deploys, configures, monitors, and manages all AI agents as part of the managed service. Your firm does not need IT staff, data scientists, or AI expertise. CodioOps - bundled with every engagement - handles all ongoing management and optimization.',

  },
  {
    question: 'Is GlobalCodio suitable for solo immigration law firms?',
    answer:
      'Yes. GlobalCodio serves solo, mid-size, and enterprise immigration law firms. Solo and small firms benefit most from AI agents that replace the work of multiple paralegals and the managed operations model that eliminates the need for any internal IT or technology management.',

    question: 'What is the typical ROI for immigration law firms using GlobalCodio?',

      'Immigration law firms using GlobalCodio typically see a 3× ROI in year one. This combines cost savings from reduced case preparation time (70% reduction), eliminated staff overhead for routine work (equivalent of $499,000/year), and recovered renewal revenue ($50,000–$300,000 from dormant client reactivation).',

Executive-ready reporting is built in.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How does GlobalCodio help HR teams manage employee immigration without waiting on outside counsel?',
    answer:
      'GlobalCodio\'s HR portal allows HR and mobility teams to initiate immigration workflows, collect employee information, and build the case file independently - weeks before outside counsel is engaged. When the law firm is brought in, they inherit a complete file with no double data entry or coordination delay.',

    question: 'What encryption standards does GlobalCodio use?',
